ðŸŽ¯ Essential Patterns to Memorize
Powers of 2 Shortcuts

/24 = 256 IPs (2^8 host bits)
/25 = 128 IPs (2^7 host bits)
/26 = 64 IPs (2^6 host bits)
/27 = 32 IPs (2^5 host bits)
/28 = 16 IPs (2^4 host bits)
/30 = 4 IPs (2^2 host bits) - Perfect for point-to-point links

Quick Mental Math Tricks

Host Bits = 32 - CIDR

/24 â†’ 32-24 = 8 host bits â†’ 2^8 = 256 total IPs


Usable IPs = Total - 2

Always subtract 2 (network + broadcast addresses)


Subnet Mask Patterns

/24 = 255.255.255.0 (most common)
/25 = 255.255.255.128 (128 = 10000000 in binary)
/26 = 255.255.255.192 (192 = 11000000 in binary)
/30 = 255.255.255.252 (252 = 11111100 in binary)



ðŸ“š NetPractice-Specific Tips
Common Scenarios You'll Encounter

LAN segments: Usually /24 or /25
Point-to-point links: Always /30 (2 usable IPs)
Router interfaces: Must be in same subnet to communicate
Default routes: 0.0.0.0/0 means "any network"

Troubleshooting Checklist

Are devices in the same subnet? (Network portions must match)
Is the IP within the usable range? (Not network or broadcast)
Do subnet masks match on connected devices?
Are routes configured for different subnets?
